# unitree_legged_sdk 3.3.4 is compatible with ros and lcm for A1.

# TBD
- Need to clear the MESS below ðŸ˜…
- Need to add proper steps to build and use
- Need to develop a bash script for downloading requirements


# Steps:
- cd ~/temp/fast_and_efficient
- source .env/bin/activate  (activating python3.8)
- python -m src.robots.a1_robot_exercise_example

## TBD

- Need to send commands through UDP protocol
- Docker run Unitree SDK and test rosnodes
- Need to log data from a1 via UDP protocol


## Issues
- Not responding on v3.5.1
- /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lunitree_legged_sdk_arm64
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/robot_interface.dir/build.make:97: robot_interface.cpython-38-aarch64-linux-gnu.so] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:102: CMakeFiles/robot_interface.dir/all] Error 2
- Not able to build the sole unitree sdk properly on sdk
  without building yuxiang's code.

- Not able to run "python -m src.robots.a1_robot_exercise_example --use_real_robot=True" without installing the requirements.



## Resolving unitree sdk build issue

1. Raspberry PI seems to be having the same IP as TX2 (Not currently in the A1). 

   IP for the unitree quadruped is 192.168.123.X

   Sport mode uses a high level controller (need to confirm this properly)
   If sport mode, it communicates with a Tx2, X = 161 
   Basic mode uses low level controller (need to confirm this properly)
   If basic mode it communicates directly with a embedded board (not-ssh'able), X = 10

   The `example_walk` sets the control level to HIGH for the A1 which is meant to interface with the default-from-factory TX2 in 'SPORT MODE'.
   Because the TX2 was removed on the A1 named "Ghost", commands via SPORT MODE won't work.
   What makes this even more confusing is that there is a raspberry Pi installed as a replacement for the TX2 on "Ghost" which has the same IP (X=161) set.
   We were able to build and run a different `example_position` code which communicates with the Basic mode and works. We obtained this example from an earlier version of the codebase (note there are changes to API since then, such as the UDP constructors).
   
   We used the example position code from the below repo.
   Repository : [Unitree 2020](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk/blob/918d6c684b3f431416a68370603f470457cf9bae/examples/example_position.cpp)
   

   We were able to run example_position() by manually building it and thus receive data.
   Python scripts which use Pybind bindings to communciate at the low level API still work as expected.



   
## Mateo's Version
I tried getting the unitree_legged_sdk and unitree_ros_to_real working with the "right" versions for the A1 (This means SDK release 3.2, and the unitree_ros_to_real_3.2.1). If you follow the instructions in the latter's README, you need to change the commands to be the following:
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /usr/share/gazebo-11/setup.sh
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
<Mateo's comment: same export lines as in the readme for ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, UNITREE_SDK_VERSION, and UNITREE_LEGGED_SDK (but for this one make sure to give it the right path)>
export UNITREE_PLATFORM="arm64"
```

THen build with catkin build and that should work.
Then launch the launch file specified in the README for unitree_ros_to_real.
