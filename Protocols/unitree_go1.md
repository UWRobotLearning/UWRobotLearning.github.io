# Using the Unitree Go1 üêï

## Requirements for use:
1. The robot is returned in an equivalent or better working state than when it was lent out.
2. The group (e.g. PI) working with the robot promises to provide funding to cover any repairs that must be made to the robot itself or compute/sensors should something break during testing.
3. The students working with the robot keep the robot in the lab spaces or post to the #legs channel when taking the robot to a non-standard location (e.g. testing around campus).
4. The students contribute back some infrastructural work to the lab in exchange for time using the robot. 
This can be done by:
>  - Helping this documentation be accurate.
>  - Contributing sim2real deployment code within [UWLab](https://github.com/UW-Lab/UWLab).

## Battery

1. **Compute Location:** Store the tablet on top of the battery charging box. Plug the tablet into the wall charger when not in use.
2. **Battery Location:**
  - Batteries in the **"Full"** Section: üîã‚úÖ ready
  - Batteries in the **"Empty"** Section: üîã‚ùå needs charging
3. **[Charging](https://www.unitree.com/go1/battery)**: 
  - If there are batteries left uncharged, please charge them using the Charging Box when around the lab.
  - **DO NOT** leave the batteries charging unattended for longer than 30 minutes.
  - **DO NOT** bend the cable during charging.
4. **Robot Storage:**
  - Keep robot clear of mocap arena.
  - When robot testing is complete, drive Go1 back to the area in Allen 014 shown in the image and take the batteries out for charging.
  - **DO NOT** leave the battery inserted when the robot is not operational.
  
## Usage Procedure

TODO

## Outdoor Use
- ‚â• 2 people must be present when testing.
- Ensure there are no people downhill from the robot at all times (including the operator).
- The operator must be comfortable with the E-stop procedure and the tablet must be configured for E-stop even if Go1 is being controlled via the API.
- ‚ùó**Take Video** with phone and/or drone!

## Emergency Stop
Please read the [Unitree documentation on stopping the robot](https://shop.unitree.com/products/unitreeyushutechnologydog-artificial-intelligence-companion-bionic-companion-intelligent-robot-go1-quadruped-robot-dog?srsltid=AfmBOooba0_MRn19GjD1zGwofRBX4bDgyV6MLNKRJXRVN97Hk7QJu2ir) for complete info.



## Updating Firmware
Please refrain from changing the firmware on the robots or the remotes until discussing with senior PhD students in lab.
